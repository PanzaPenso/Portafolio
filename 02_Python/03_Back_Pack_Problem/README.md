# BackPack Problem v1.0

A software that can take as input a collection of Tetris pieces and a container, then places the pieces inside the container at the next available space (from the bottom left corner) and finally returns the resulting configuration. Letâ€™s review one by one these concepts.

1. In the input, the container is represented by two values M and N. In the software, the container is represented by a matrix C=M x N whit 0 at all positions when initialized. In the example below, a container C with size M = 7 and N = 8 on the left, and the initialized state of the matrix on the right.

2. In the input, the Tetris pieces are represented by multi-dimensional arrays as follows:

1 = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] 
2 = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0]] 
3 = [[1, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]] 
4 = [[1, 1], [1, 0], [1, 0]] 
5 = [[1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]
6 = [[0,1,1],[1,1,0]] 
7 = [[0,1,0],[1,1,1]] 
8 = [[1,1],[1,1]]
9 = [[1], [1], [1], [1]] 
10 =[[1,1,1,1]]

3. The algorithm should place the pieces in the order they are specified in the input.Starting from the lower left corner, from left to right, from bottom to top.
