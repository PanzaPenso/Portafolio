# Hi_Im_Panza_Source_Code

This repository is intended for exercises, training and personal projects, which have helped me throughout my career to improve my skills as a systems engineer.

I am currently an enthusiast in careers involving "DATA"; data engineer, data analyst or data science. However in this profession there are so many things to learn that a lifetime is too short.

Some time ago I started with development exercises (which has not been my field for many years) and that has led me to get fond of other branches.

In this repository you can find 3 folders:

1. Python
2. Unity
3. WebDev

Inside each folder you will find the name of the exercise, along with a file "readme.md" where you will have more information, for example: If it is an invented exercise, if it was taken from some page or if the exercise belongs to a specific person. The idea is not to take these solutions as my own, but to recognize other people's work.
