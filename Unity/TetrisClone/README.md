# Building a Tetris Clone

This is a practice to understand how Unity works, its components and the logic behind a video game.

The best way is to take a classic game and try to recreate it.

For this reason I have taken "TETRIS" as the basis of the exercise. I tried several ways on my own however after 1 month, I opted to seek help.

I recommend Wilmer Lin's course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/share/101YDE3@6UbHCGsSCgy_XIEhGCn_8LyJq8A2VNmHxd9MvOLwK3h9tVTapNwYCJHztL12IWtt/), where he explains in detail how to build the game from point 0, explaining every function and detail of the tool.
